Hunting activity for extendedmode

**Installation**

Copy ExM_Hunting to your resources folder and add `ensure ExM_Hunting` to your server.cfg, then import the `exm_hunting.sql` to your database.

**Config**

There are a heap of config options, you can change the marker locations, sizes, colours, etc. You can change which animals can be hunted, the max amount of max given from animals, how much they sell for and a whole lot more. Just take a look at the config it's pretty self explanatory.

This requires [extendedmode](https://github.com/extendedmode/extendedmode) which is a community based esx fork, that is fully backward compatible and has new exclusive features.
